# ü§ñ N√§V√Æ Personal Assistant

N√§v√Æ is a custom, Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased AI assistant crafted for personal use and convenience. By leveraging voice activation (‚ÄúHey N√§v√Æ‚Äù), it captures audio input, converts it to text, and processes requests through a GPT-based model to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Results are then relayed back through text-to-speech (Amazon Polly), creating a fully integrated voice assistant solution.


Beyond basic voice interactions, N√§v√Æ's extensible architecture supports advanced use cases including:
      * Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection (IDS) for home networks
      * Camera-based security integration
      * IoT device management and control
